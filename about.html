                    My name is Ákos Tibor Hadar. I was born in 2005 in the Hungarian Transcarpathian village of 
                    Csongor (pronounced 'Chongor'). I spent the bulk of my childhood there with most of my family 
                    until 2013, at which point my father moved to London and my mother to Budapest. After 3 more 
                    years with my grandparents, I joined my father in May of 2016. As I had no English knowledge at 
                    the time, I spent my first Summer learning the language from one of our flatmates and now very 
                    close friends. Even today, almost 10 years later, I would describe that Summer as the best one 
                    I've had so far. 

                    At the end of the Summer, I joined The Crest Academy in Brent, London where I completed eight 
                    GCSEs with the majority of my final grades being 8s and 9s. Having completed my GCSEs, I then started A-levels in Guildford 
                    County School studying Physics, Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science. While there, I took part in the UKMT Senior 
                    Mathematical Challenge of 2022, recieving a Gold Certificate, and also received the Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award. 

                    In the Summer of 2023, I, my father and another close friend of ours embarked on a cycling trip from London to Budapest, 
                    setting off on the 2nd and arriving to the infamous 'Square of Heroes' (Hősök Tere) on the 15th of July. Just 2 months later 
                    in September, I started an Integrated Master's course in Mathematics and Physics (MPhys) at the University of Surrey where I
                    am currently averaging a First Class. 

                    Since my arrival to the University, I have taken part in the 2025 International Physics Tournament hosted by IOP, representing 
                    the UK through Surrey. (the paper our team produced is available to read on the 'Projects' page). I have also worked as a Re-
                    search Assistant for 2 months in the Physics Department at the University of Oxford in the context of a paid internship, looking 
                    at the use of reduced-precision arithmetic, stochastic physics and machine learning in weather forecasting.

                    I would like to obtain a PhD in Physics or Mathematics. My main goal is to become a Particle Physicist or Mathematician and 
                    conduct research in Quantum Theory, Standard Model Physics, Number Theory or the Study of Dynamical Systems. The latter 
                    is notably inspired by the amazing teaching of one of my professors, Prof. Cesare Tronci.
