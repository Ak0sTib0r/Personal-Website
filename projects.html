                    In 2025, I was part of the UK team for the International Physics Tournament (IPT) hosted by IOP. This is a competition 
                    between physics students from Universities all around the globe. My University (University of Surrey) has been selected 
                    to represent the UK through a national competition in which we defeated a team from Imperial College London. As part of 
                    the competition, my team needed to produce a paper on one of 17 set problems. In the paper, I was responsible for designing
                    an experiment as well as constructing a mathematical model to describe the problem. You can read this paper <a href="Optimal_Candle(IPT Paper).pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.

                    Personal Assistant AI: Mable
                </h2>
                <pre>
                    Mable was the first major project I've ever been engaged in. It was the Non-Exam Assessment (NEA) component of my
                    Computer Science A-Level. The AI Boom was just really starting to get going when I needed to come up with a project 
                    idea for this course. So, I thought I'd try my hand at creating my own virtual 'personal assistant'. I took inspiration from 
                    software such as Cortana, Siri and Alexa when thinking about what type of functionality this new bot should have. I also 
                    created a GUI for the project which was inspired by Cortana's interface and with which I was quite pleased with in the end.

                    As I wanted Mable to support voice command, the biggest part of the project was creating a custom language analysis 
                    system (more professionally known as a Natural Language Processing System or NLPS). This was quite challenging but I 
                    learned a lot in the process. Within the NLPS, I had by far the most fun creating my own Hash function. This was necessary 
                    to save time on language processing as I needed to categorise a lot of frequently used words and needed to make usre that 
                    the bot had a fast way of looking up words in an input.

                <h2>
                    Philosophical Work: 'Will we ever create true AI: The Meaning of Human Intelligence'
                </h2>
                <pre>
                     During A-Level, I decided to take up an EPQ (Extended Project Qualification) to write about a philosophical topic which
                     was very much relevant at the time. The major AI Boom began roughly around 2021, just at the end of the COVID pandemic,
                     and so I decided to create a contemplary work looking at how modern psychologists defined and assessed Human intelligence.
                     I then used these models to construct a summary ('Revised Model' in the EPQ) model and apply it to AI. 
                     
                     By 'apply', I mean I was curious to see what would happen if we assessed the intelligence of the, at the time, best theoretically
                     possible AI model using standards set for Human intelligence measure. To this end, I finished writing <a href="Akos Hadar EPQ.pdf" target="_blank">my EPQ</a> in the Summer 
                     of 2022 with 96%.
