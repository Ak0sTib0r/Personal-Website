                    Simulation Theory and Why You Should Ignore It
                </h2>

                    Me and my father often engage in fun academic or intellectual sparring with each other. One common topic that
                    comes up in our battles is the Simulation Hypothesis. My dad is in fact a big supporter of this theory and finds 
                    it quite appealing whereas I am a vicious critic of the idea. He always finds it amusing when I start listing all
                    the reasons I believe the theory is clearly non-sense in my opinion. It was in one of these battles that I finally
                    could put into words what I, at the time, called 'the best thought I will probably ever have'. I would like to share
                    this thought here with whoever will come to read it and hopefully convince you that the theory with which we are 
                    concerned with here is really not worth talking about in the context of any serious academic consideration.   

                    Let's begin by establishing why a civilization capable of creating life-like simulations inhabited by conscious beings
                    would be motivated to do so. Of course, one might say that just the fact that they're capable of doing this would be 
                    reason enough.

                    Let's suppose that we in fact are in a simulation. More specifically, let's suppose that a computer in 'base reality' is 
                    currently running a simulation. It is not unreasonable to think that in time, the civilization in that simulated world reached 
                    a technological maturity such that they themselves can run their own simulated world. This can then cascade down for some 
                    amount of levels. With each level, the amount of compute power available will decrease as each level is being supported by the 
                    base reality computer. Hence, there is some maximum amount of levels which can be simulated. Now, according to the simulation 
                    hypothesis, we are at one of these levels but not at base reality. 

                    We currently obvious do not have our own such simulation. However, if we would be able to create such a program, then we would 
                    expect to see the same level generation process to occur with some time. As in we would expect to see more levels of the simulation 
                    emerge as the previous one created them. At some point, as we said before, we would also run out of compute power.
