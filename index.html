                    I'm Ákos. I'm a Maths and Physics student at the University of Surrey, studying towards a Master's degree in Physics.
                    I would later like to get a PhD in Physics or Mathematics and work in academia.

                    I'm currently engaged in a summer project in the context of a paid internship in the Physics Department at the University
                    of Oxford. I'm helping the Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics (AOPP) Department look at the use of reduced-
                    precision arithmetic, stochastic physics and machine learning in weather forecasting. My supervisors are Drs <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/kloewer" target="_blank">Milan Kloewer</a>,
                    <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/cooperf" target="_blank">Fenwick Cooper</a>, <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/nath" target="_blank">Shruti Nath</a> and <a href="https://www.physics.ox.ac.uk/our-people/elbertb" target="_blank">Bryony Elbert Straker</a>.

                    As well as producing a report for AOPP, I'm currently working on a paper (for fun) which discusses different methods of finding the nth prime. One of these methods 
                    has been developed by me and asymptotically approaches 100% accuracy.

                    I am planning on launching a website, the Student Papers' Archive (or SPArc). This site will serve as a place where eager University students can publish articles or 
                    short papers on topics they find interesting. I would like to include an online journal on the site so that students who would like to later go into academia can get a 
                    taste of what this world is roughly like (at least the publishing and research parts) to get them a clearer picture whether or not it's right for them.
